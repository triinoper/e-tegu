- You current progress on developing the group project (including a demo of your deliverables)
  So far we have a working interactive prototype that has the basic functionality. User can create projects, vote for projects, change and modify setting for their account, search for projects and look at a project. We still have to iterate the visual design of the app based on the recent feedback from specialists but also from the client (E-Governance Academy). At the same time we have to start developing the actual working Android app.
  The current prototype can be found here: https://marvelapp.com/4h17d47/screen/40662758
